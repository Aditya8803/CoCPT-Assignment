        <h2>Key Features of GoCPT BETA</h2>
        <div class="feature-grid">
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>User Friendly</h3>
                <p>The goCPT app offers a user-friendly feature for 
                    determining CPT codes based on time alone. To utilize
                    this functionality, simply navigate to the designated 
                    time button within the app and input the total time 
                    spent managing the patient during the encounter. The 
                    app will then generate the appropriate CPT code, 
                    considering the significant role of time in certain 
                    scenarios, such as counseling or coordination of care,
                    in determining the level of service provided</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Medical Complexity Assessment</h3>
                <p>The goCPT app calculates encounters of varying complexity (straightforward/minimal, low, moderate, and high) based on a meticulous assessment of Medical Decision-Making (MDM), taking into account the number of diagnoses, management options, risk of complications or morbidity, and the amount and complexity of data reviewed during the encounter</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>E&M Code Integration</h3>
                <p>Seamlessly incorporates the key components influencing E&M code selection, such as History of Present Illness (HPI), Examination, Medical Decision-Making (MDM), and Time considerations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Streamlined Documentation</h3>
                <p>Facilitates accurate code assignment by providing a user-friendly interface for configuring CPT billing codes directly from your progress notes. The app emphasizes documentation accuracy to capture the true complexity of the services rendered**</p>
